E-Learning Management System
Introduction
The E-Learning Management System is a modern web application designed to streamline online learning and teaching processes. Built on the MERN stack, this project supports two distinct roles:

Instructor: Capable of creating, editing, and managing courses. Instructors can upload lectures, update or delete them, and view a comprehensive dashboard with revenue insights.

Student: Can browse available courses, purchase those that interest them, attend classes, and monitor their progress throughout each course.

This platform leverages MongoDB for its flexible database structure and integrates third-party services like Cloudinary for media storage and Razorpay for payment processing.

Tech Stack
The project integrates the following technologies:

Frontend: React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap (or Tailwind CSS) for a responsive, engaging UI.

Backend: Node.js and Express to build a robust REST API.

Database: MongoDB, which powers dynamic collections for users, courses, purchases, and videos.

Authentication & Security: JWT for authentication, alongside secure routes and data handling.

Payment Gateway: Razorpay, ensuring a safe and efficient payment process.

Cloud Storage: Cloudinary for handling media (images/videos) uploads.

Additional Tools: npm for package management, and Git for version control.

Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository locally, run the following commands in your terminal:

bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-learning-management-system.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd e-learning-management-system
Replace the GitHub URL with the actual repository URL.

Setup & Installation
Backend Setup
Navigate to the Backend Folder:

bash
cd backend
Install Dependencies:

bash
npm install
Create the Configuration File:

Create a .env file in the backend folder with the following content:

PORT=8080
MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection String>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret>
SECRET_KEY=<Your Secret Key>

# Cloudinary Setup
API_KEY=<Your Cloudinary API Key>
API_SECRET=<Your Cloudinary API Secret>
CLOUD_NAME=<Your Cloudinary Cloud Name>

# Instructor Code
INSTRUCTOR_CODE=admin123

# Payment Gateway (Razorpay)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=<Your Razorpay Key ID>
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=<Your Razorpay Key Secret>
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<Your Razorpay Webhook Secret>
Ensure you replace the placeholder values (<...>) with your actual configuration values.

Start the Backend Server:

bash
npm start
Frontend Setup
Navigate to the Frontend Folder:

Typically, your frontend code is located in another folder (e.g., client):

bash
cd ../client
Install Dependencies:

bash
npm install
Run the Frontend Application:

bash
npm start
Your React application should now be running on your local development server.

Further Steps
Database Models: The MongoDB collections include four primary types:

User: Stores information for both students and instructors.

Course: Contains course details, metadata, and associated lectures.

Purchase: Tracks course purchases made by students.

Video: Manages video lectures associated with courses.

Routing & Authentication: Make sure that the API endpoints are secured and that the user authentication flow using JWT is properly handled.

Payment & Media Integration: Ensure that Cloudinary and Razorpay configurations are working as expected for media uploads and payment processing.

Contribution & Deployment: For any contribution guidelines or deployment instructions (e.g., using Docker, CI/CD tools), add dedicated sections to this README.

This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and understanding your MERN stack E-Learning Management System. Feel free to expand any section, provide additional usage instructions, or include more visuals and documentation as your project evolves.

If you have any questions regarding configuration, usage, or deployment, consider adding a "Troubleshooting" or "FAQ" section at the end of your documentation.
